Tailwind Setup (quick reference)
Ensure Tailwind is configured for Vite + React:

tailwind.config.js
content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}']
index.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Routing
Example routes (adjust to your app):

/ ‚Üí Home
/about ‚Üí About
/contact ‚Üí Contact
/user or /:userId ‚Üí User
/github ‚Üí Github
Environment Variables
If any route fetches data (e.g., Github), create a .env file at project root:

.env
.env.local
Do not commit env files; they should be in .gitignore.

Deployment
Build output is generated in dist/. You can deploy to:

Vercel
Netlify
GitHub Pages
Any static host
For SPA routing on static hosts, ensure unknown routes fall back to index.html (e.g., Netlify _redirects rule: /* /index.html 200).

Screenshots (optional)
You can embed images used in Home.jsx:
